# hornetq-checkstyle-checks
custom checkstyles checks for HornetQ


This is now a dead/deprecated project, since this has been donated to sevntu. Use sevntu instead.

https://github.com/sevntu-checkstyle/sevntu.checkstyle/issues/321

I have donated it as a PR, but it was totally reworked accordingly to their terms, while the idea was still preserved.
